# Copado


Hi Again,
I try to do everything you ask for. I hope we will meet soon :)

--Instructions--
Simply add the project to your Visual Studio Community I used 2017 version of that.
I used Google Chrome Driver for Selenium C#
Chrome Must be updated to it's latest version.
Selenium driver must be added to this project. 

Start the code and the and bot should start automaticly.

There is something wrong with the project I think I made a mistake when i create the C# Project.
Thank you for the opportunity.
